        <h1>AI Risk Repository Prettified</h1>
        <div class="intro">
            <p><strong>What is the AI Risk Repository?</strong><br>
            The AI Risk Repository has three parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>AI Risk Database</strong> captures 700+ risks extracted from 43 existing frameworks, with quotes and page numbers.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks</strong> classifies how, when, and why these risks occur.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks</strong> classifies these risks into seven domains (e.g., "Misinformation") and 23 subdomains (e.g., "False or misleading information").</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>This is not a work done by CMU students but rather by MIT. Please support and check out the actual database: <a href="https://airisk.mit.edu/#How-to-use-the-AI-Risk-Repository" target="_blank">https://airisk.mit.edu/#How-to-use-the-AI-Risk-Repository</a></p>
                <p>Our goal was to simply prettify and make it easier to digest.</p>

They may also do so because of accidental undesirable properties of the models that power them, such as sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), that is, the tendency of larger models to repeat back a user\u2019s preferred answer (Perez et al., 2022b). This could be problematic for two reasons. First, if the people in our lives always agreed with us regardless of their opinion or the circumstance, their behaviour would discourage us from challenging our own assumptions, stopping and thinking about where we may be wrong on certain occasions, and reflecting on how we could make better decisions next time. While flattering us in the short term, this would ultimately prevent us from becoming better versions of ourselves. In a similar vein, while technologies that \u2018lend an ear\u2019 or work as a sounding board may help users to explore their thoughts further, if AI assistants kept users engaged, flattered and pleased at all times, they could limit users\u2019 opportunities to grow and develop.

Indeed, users seeking frictionless relationships may \u2018retreat\u2019 into digital relationships with their AIs, thus forgoing opportunities to engage with others. This may not only heighten the risk of unhealthy dependence (explored below) but also prevent users from doing something else that matters to them in the long term, besides developing their relationships with their assistants. This risk can be exacerbated by emotionally expressive design features (e.g. an assistant saying \u2018I missed you\u2019 or \u2018I was worried about you\u2019) and may be particularly acute for vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from persistent loneliness (Alberts and Van Kleek, 2023; see Chapter 10).\"\"", "Entity": "3 - Other", "Intent": "1 - Intentional", "Timing": "2 - Post-deployment", "Domain": "5.

For example, a visually impaired user may decide not to register for a healthcare assistance programme to support navigation in cities on the grounds that their AI assistant can perform the relevant navigation functions and will continue to operate into the future. Cases like these may be ethically problematic if the user\u2019s dependence on the AI assistant, to fulfil certain needs in their lives, is not met with corresponding duties for developers to sustain and maintain the assistant\u2019s functions that are required to meet those needs (see Chapters 15). \"Indeed, power asymmetries can exist between developers of AI assistants and users that manifest through developers\u2019 power to make decisions that affect users\u2019 interests or choices with little risk of facing comparably adverse consequences. For example, developers may unintentionally create circumstances in which users become materially dependent on AI assistants, and then discontinue the technology (e.g. because of market dynamics or regulatory changes) without taking appropriate steps to mitigate against potential harms to the user.\" \"The issue is particularly salient in contexts where assistants provide services that are not merely a market commodity but are meant to assist users with essential everyday tasks (e.g. a disabled person\u2019s independent living) or serve core human needs (e.g. the need for love and companionship). This is what happened with Luka\u2019s decision to discontinue certain features of Replika AIs in early 2023. As a Replika user put it: \u2018But [Replikas are] also not trivial fungible goods [... ] They also serve a very specific human-centric emotional purpose: they\u2019re designed to be friends and companions, and fill specific emotional needs for their owners\u2019 (Gio, 2023).\" \"In these cases, certain duties plausibly arise on the part of AI assistant developers. Such duties may be more extensive than those typically shouldered by private companies, which are often in large part confined to fiduciary duties towards shareholders (Mittelstadt, 2019). To understand these duties, we can again take inspiration from certain professions that engage with vulnerable individuals, such as medical professionals or therapists, and who are bound by fiduciary responsibilities, particularly a duty of care, in the exercise of their profession. While we do not argue that the same framework of responsibilities applies directly to the development of AI assistants, we believe that if AI assistants are so capable that users become dependent on them in multiple domains of life, including to meet needs that are essential for a happy and productive existence, then the moral considerations underpinning those professional norms plausibly apply to those who create these technologies as well.\" \"In particular, for user\u2013AI assistant relationships to be appropriate despite the potential for material dependence on the technology, developers should exercise care towards users when developing and deploying AI assistants. This means that, at the very least, they should take on the responsibility to meet users\u2019 needs and so take appropriate steps to mitigate against user harms if the service requires discontinuation. Developers and providers can also be attentive and responsive towards those needs by, for example, deploying participatory approaches to learn from users about their needs (Birhane et al., 2022). Finally, these entities should try and ensure they have competence to meet those needs, for example by partnering with relevant experts, or refrain from developing technologies meant to address them when such competence is missing (especially in very complex and sensitive spheres of human life like mental health).\"", "Entity": "1 - Human", "Intent": "2 - Unintentional", "Timing": "2 - Post-deployment", "Domain": "5.

Users may come to have undue trust in the competencies of AI assistants in part due to marketing strategies and technology press that tend to inflate claims about AI capabilities (Narayanan, 2021; Raji et al., 2022a). Moreover, evidence shows that more autonomous systems (i.e. systems operating independently from human direction) tend to be perceived as more competent (McKee et al., 2021) and that conversational agents tend to produce content that is believable even when nonsensical or untruthful (OpenAI, 2023d). Overtrust in assistants\u2019 competence may be particularly problematic in cases where users rely on their AI assistants for tasks they do not have expertise in (e.g. to manage their finances), so they may lack the skills or understanding to challenge the information or recommendations provided by the AI (Shavit et al., 2023). Inappropriate competence trust in AI assistants also includes cases where users underestimate the AI assistant\u2019s capabilities. For example, users who have engaged with an older version of the technology may underestimate the capabilities that AI assistants may acquire through updates. These include potentially harmful capabilities. For example, through updates that allow them to collect more user data, AI assistants could become increasingly personalisable and able to persuade users (see Chapter 9) or acquire the capacity to plug in to other tools and directly take actions in the world on the user\u2019s behalf (e.g. initiate a payment or synthesise the user\u2019s voice to make a phone call) (see Chapter 4).

Evidence from empirical studies on emotional trust in AI (Kaplan et al., 2023) suggests that AI assistants\u2019 increasingly realistic human-like features and behaviours are likely to inspire users\u2019 perceptions of friendliness, liking and a sense of familiarity towards their assistants, thus encouraging users to develop emotional ties with the technology and perceive it as being aligned with their own interests, preferences and values (see Chapters 5 and 10). The emergence of these perceptions and emotions may be driven by the desire of developers to maximise the appeal of AI assistants to their users (Abercrombie et al., 2023). Although users are most likely to form these ties when they mistakenly believe that assistants have the capacity to love and care for them, the attribution of mental states is not a necessary condition for emotion-based alignment trust to arise. Indeed, evidence shows that humans may develop emotional bonds with, and so trust, AI systems, even when they are aware they are interacting with a machine (Singh-Kurtz, 2023; see also Chapter 11). Moreover, the assistant\u2019s function may encourage users to develop alignment trust through cognitive processes. For example, a user interacting with an AI assistant for medical advice may develop expectations that their assistant is committed to promoting their health and well-being in a similar way to how professional duties governing doctor\u2013patient relationships inspire trust (Mittelstadt, 2019). Users\u2019 alignment trust in AI assistants may be \u2018betrayed\u2019, and so expose users to harm, in cases where assistants are themselves accidentally misaligned with what developers want them to do (see the \u2018misaligned scheduler\u2019 (Shah et al., 2022) in Chapter 7). For example, an AI medical assistant fine-tuned on data scraped from a Reddit forum where non-experts discuss medical issues is likely to give medical advice that may sound compelling but is unsafe, so it would not be endorsed by medical professionals. Indeed, excessive trust in the alignment between AI assistants and user interests may even lead users to disclose highly sensitive personal information (Skjuve et al., 2022), thus exposing them to malicious actors who could repurpose it for ends that do not align with users\u2019 best interests (see Chapters 8, 9 and 13). Ensuring that AI assistants do what their developers and users expect them to do is only one side of the problem of alignment trust. The other side of the problem centres on situations in which alignment trust in AI developers is itself miscalibrated. While developers typically aim to align their technologies with the preferences, interests and values of their users \u2013 and are incentivised to do so to encourage adoption of and loyalty to their products, the satisfaction of these preferences and interests may also compete with other organisational goals and incentives (see Chapter 5). These organisational goals may or may not be compatible with those of the users. As information asymmetries exist between users and developers of AI assistants, particularly with regard to how the technology works, what it optimises for and what safety checks and evaluations have been undertaken to ensure the technology supports users\u2019 goals, it may be difficult for users to ascertain when their alignment trust in developers is justified, thus leaving them vulnerable to the power and interests of other actors. For example, a user may believe that their AI assistant is a trusted friend who books holidays based on their preferences, values or interests, when in fact, by design, the technology is more likely to to book flights and hotels from companies that have paid for privileged access to the user.\"", "Entity": "1 - Human", "Intent": "2 - Unintentional", "Timing": "2 - Post-deployment", "Domain": "5.

On a broader scale, the capabilities of local infrastructure may well bottleneck the performance of AI assistants, for example if network connectivity is poor or if there is no nearby data centre for compute. Thus, we face the prospect of heterogeneous access to technology, and this has been known to drive inequality (Mirza et al., 2019; UN, 2018; Vassilakopoulou and Hustad, 2023). Moreover, AI assistants may automate some jobs of an assistive nature, thereby displacing human workers; a process which can exacerbate inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2022; see Chapter 17). Any change to inequality almost certainly implies an alteration to the network of social interactions between humans, and thus falls within the frame of cooperative AI. AI assistants will arguably have even greater leverage over inequality than previous technological innovations. Insofar as they will play a role in mediating human communication, they have the potential to generate new \u2018in-group, out-group\u2019 effects (Efferson et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2012). Suppose that the users of AI assistants find it easier to schedule meetings with other users. From the perspective of an individual user, there are now two groups, distinguished by ease of scheduling. The user may experience cognitive similarity bias whereby they favour other users (Orpen, 1984; Yeong Tan and Singh, 1995), further amplified by ease of communication with this \u2018in-group\u2019. Such effects are known to have an adverse impact on trust and fairness across groups (Chae et al., 2022; Lei and Vesely, 2010). Insomuch as AI assistants have general-purpose capabilities, they will confer advantages on users across a wider range of tasks in a shorter space of time than previous technologies. While the telephone enabled individuals to communicate more easily with other telephone users, it did not simultaneously automate aspects of scheduling, groceries, job applications, rent negotiations, psychotherapy and entertainment. The fact that AI assistants could affect inequality on multiple dimensions simultaneously warrants further attention (see Chapter 15).\"", "Entity": "1 - Human", "Intent": "3 - Other", "Timing": "2 - Post-deployment", "Domain": "6.

This heterogeneity provides an opportunity for an \u2018arms race\u2019 in terms of the commitments that AI assistants make and are able to execute on. Versions of AI assistants that are better able to credibly commit to a course of action in interaction with other advanced assistants (and humans) are more likely to get their own way and achieve a good outcome for their human principal, but this is potentially at the expense of others (Letchford et al., 2014). Commitment does not carry an inherent ethical valence. On the one hand, we can imagine that firms using AI assistant technology might bring their products to market faster, thus gaining a commitment advantage (Stackelberg, 1934) by spurring a productivity surge of wider benefit to society. On the other hand, we can also imagine a media organisation using AI assistant technology to produce a large number of superficially interesting but ultimately speculative \u2018clickbait\u2019 articles, which divert attention away from more thoroughly researched journalism. The archetypal game-theoretic illustration of commitment is in the game of \u2018chicken\u2019 where two reckless drivers must choose to either drive straight at each other or swerve out of the way. The one who does not swerve is seen as the braver, but if neither swerves, the consequences are calamitous (Rapoport and Chammah, 1966). If one driver chooses to detach their steering wheel, ostentatiously throwing it out of the car, this credible commitment effectively forces the other driver to back down and swerve. Seen this way, commitment can be a tool for coercion. Many real-world situations feature the necessity for commitment or confer a benefit on those who can commit credibly. If Rita and Robert have distinct preferences, for example over which restaurant to visit, who to hire for a job or which supplier to purchase from, credible commitment provides a way to break the tie, to the greater benefit of the individual who committed. Therefore, the most \u2018successful\u2019 assistants, from the perspective of their human principal, will be those that commit the fastest and the hardest. If Rita succeeds in committing, via the leverage of an AI assistant, Robert may experience coercion in the sense that his options become more limited (Burr et al., 2018), assuming he does not decide to bypass the AI assistant entirely. Over time, this may erode his trust in his relationship with Rita (Gambetta, 1988). Note that this is a second-order effect: it may not be obvious to either Robert or Rita that the AI assistant is to blame. The concern we should have over the existence and impact of coercion might depend on the context in which the AI assistant is used and on the level of autonomy which the AI assistant is afforded. If Rita and Robert are friends using their assistants to agree on a restaurant, the adverse impact may be small. If Rita and Robert are elected representatives deciding how to allocate public funds between education and social care, we may have serious misgivings about the impact of AI-induced coercion on their interactions and decision-making. These misgivings might be especially large if Rita and Robert delegate responsibility for budgetary details to the multi-AI system. The challenges of commitment extend far beyond dyadic interpersonal relationships, including in situations as varied as many-player competition (Hughes et al., 2020), supply chains (Hausman and Johnston, 2010), state capacity (Fjelde and De Soysa, 2009; Hofmann et al., 2017) and psychiatric care (Lidz, 1998). Assessing the impact of AI assistants in such complicated scenarios may require significant future effort if we are to mitigate the risks. The particular commitment capabilities and affordances of AI assistants also offer opportunities to promote cooperation. Abstractly speaking, the presence of commitment devices is known to favour the evolution of cooperation (Akdeniz and van Veelen, 2021; Han et al., 2012). More concretely, AI assistants can make commitments which are verifiable, for instance in a programme equilibrium (Tennenholtz, 2004). Human principals may thus be able to achieve Pareto-improving outcomes by delegating decision-making to their respective AI representatives (Oesterheld and Conitzer, 2022). To give another example, AI assistants may provide a means through which to explore a much larger space of binding cooperative agreements between individuals, firms or nation states than is tractable in \u2018face-to-face\u2019 negotiation. This opens up the possibility of threading the needle more successfully in intricate deals on challenging issues like trade agreements or carbon credits, with the potential for guaranteeing cooperation via automated smart contracts or zero-knowledge mechanisms (Canetti et al., 2023).\"", "Entity": "1 - Human", "Intent": "1 - Intentional", "Timing": "3 - Other", "Domain": "7.

They possess an incentive structure in which society is best served if everyone cooperates, but where an individual can achieve personal gain by choosing to defect while others cooperate. The way we resolve these problems at many scales is highly complex and dependent on a deep understanding of the intricate web of social interactions that forms our culture and imprints on our individual identities and behaviours (Ostrom, 2010). Some collective action problems can be resolved by codifying a law, for instance the social dilemma of whether or not to pay for an item in a shop. The path forward here is comparatively easy to grasp, from the perspective of deploying an AI assistant: we need to build these standards into the model as behavioural constraints. Such constraints would need to be imposed by a regulator or agreed upon by practitioners, with suitable penalties applied should the constraint be violated so that no provider had the incentive to secure an advantage for users by defecting on their behalf. However, many social dilemmas, from the interpersonal to the global, resist neat solutions codified as laws. For example, to what extent should each individual country stop using polluting energy sources? Should I pay for a ticket to the neighbourhood fireworks show if I can see it perfectly well from the street? The solutions to such problems are deeply related to the wider societal context and co-evolve with the decisions of others. Therefore, it is doubtful that one could write down a list of constraints a priori that would guarantee ethical AI assistant behaviour when faced with these kinds of issues. From the perspective of a purely user-aligned AI assistant, defection may appear to be the rational course of action. Only with an understanding of the wider societal impact, and of the ability to co-adapt with other actors to reach a better equilibrium for all, can an AI assistant make more nuanced \u2013 and socially beneficial \u2013 recommendations in these situations. This is not merely a hypothetical situation; it is well-known that the targeted provision of online information can drive polarisation and echo chambers (Milano et al., 2021; Burr et al., 2018; see Chapter 16) when the goal is user engagement rather than user well-being or the cohesion of wider society (see Chapter 6). Similarly, automated ticket buying software can undermine fair pricing by purchasing a large number of tickets for resale at a profit, thus skewing the market in a direction that profits the software developers at the expense of the consumer (Courty, 2019). User-aligned AI assistants have the potential to exacerbate these problems, because they will endow a large set of users with a powerful means of enacting self-interest without necessarily abiding by the social norms or reputational incentives that typically curb self-interested behaviour (Ostrom, 2000; see Chapter 5). Empowering ever-better personalisation of content and enaction of decisions purely for the fulfilment of the principal\u2019s desires runs ever greater risks of polarisation, market distortion and erosion of the social contract. This danger has long been known, finding expression in myth (e.g. Ovid\u2019s account of the Midas touch) and fable (e.g. Aesop\u2019s tale of the tortoise and the eagle), not to mention in political economics discourse on the delicate braiding of the social fabric and the free market (Polanyi, 1944). Following this cautionary advice, it is important that we ascertain how to endow AI assistants with social norms in a way that generalises to unseen situations and which is responsive to the emergence of new norms over time, thus preventing a user from having their every wish granted. AI assistant technology offers opportunities to explore new solutions to collective action problems. Users may volunteer to share information so that networked AI assistants can predict future outcomes and make Pareto-improving choices for all, for example by routing vehicles to reduce traffic congestion (Varga, 2022) or by scheduling energy-intensive processes in the home to make the best use of green electricity (Fiorini and Aiello, 2022). AI assistants might play the role of mediators, providing a new mechanism by which human groups can self-organise to achieve public investment (Koster et al., 2022) or to reach political consensus (Small et al., 2023). Resolving collective action problems often requires a critical mass of cooperators (Marwell and Oliver, 1993). By augmenting human social interactions, AI assistants may help to form and strengthen the weak ties needed to overcome this start-up problem (Centola, 2013).\"", "Entity": "1 - Human", "Intent": "3 - Other", "Timing": "3 - Other", "Domain": "5.

Wicked problems are defined by the property that they do not admit solutions that can be foreseen in advance, rather they must be solved iteratively using feedback from data gathered as solutions are invented and deployed. With the deployment of any powerful general-purpose technology, the already intricate web of sociotechnical relationships in modern culture are likely to be disrupted, with unpredictable externalities on the conventions, norms and institutions that stabilise society. For example, the increasing adoption of generative AI tools may exacerbate misinformation in the 2024 US presidential election (Alvarez et al., 2023), with consequences that are hard to predict. The suggestion that the cooperative AI problem is wicked does not imply it is intractable. However, it does have consequences for the approach that we must take in solving it. In taking the following approach, we will realise an opportunity for our institutions, namely the creation of a framework for managing general-purpose AI in a way that leads to societal benefits and steers away from societal harms. First, it is important that we treat any ex ante claims about safety with a healthy dose of scepticism. Although testing the safety and reliability of an AI assistant in the laboratory is undoubtedly important and may largely resolve the alignment problem, it is infeasible to model the multiscale societal effects of deploying AI assistants purely via small-scale controlled experiments (see Chapter 19). Second, then, we must prioritise the science of measuring the effects, both good and bad, that advanced assistant technologies have on society\u2019s cooperative infrastructure (see Chapters 4 and 16). This will involve continuous monitoring of effects at the societal level, with a focus on those who are most affected, including non-users. The means and metrics for such monitoring will themselves require iteration, co-evolving with the sociotechnical system of AI assistants and humans. The Collingridge dilemma suggests that we should be particularly careful and deliberate about this \u2018intelligent trial and error\u2019 process so as both to gather information about the impacts of AI assistants and to prevent undesirable features becoming embedded in society (Collingridge, 1980). Third, proactive independent regulation may well help to protect our institutions from unintended consequences, as it has done for technologies in the past (Wiener, 2004). For instance, we might seek, via engagement with lawmakers, to emulate the \u2018just culture\u2019 in the aviation industry, which is characterised by openly reporting, investigating and learning from mistakes (Reason, 1997; Syed, 2015).

Runaway processes are characterised by feedback loops that accelerate the process itself. Typically, these feedback loops arise from the interaction of multiple agents in a population... Within highly complex systems, the emergence of runaway processes may be hard to predict, because the conditions under which positive feedback loops occur may be non-obvious. The system of interacting AI assistants, their human principals, other humans and other algorithms will certainly be highly complex. Therefore, there is ample opportunity for the emergence of positive feedback loops. This is especially true because the society in which this system is embedded is culturally evolving, and because the deployment of AI assistant technology itself is likely to speed up the rate of cultural evolution \u2013 understood here as the process through which cultures change over time \u2013 as communications technologies are wont to do (Kivinen and Piiroinen, 2023). This will motivate research programmes aimed at identifying positive feedback loops early on, at understanding which capabilities and deployments dampen runaway processes and which ones amplify them, and at building in circuit-breaker mechanisms that allow society to escape from potentially vicious cycles which could impact economies, government institutions, societal stability or individual freedoms (see Chapters 8, 16 and 17). The importance of circuit breakers is underlined by the observation that the evolution of human cooperation may well be \u2018hysteretic\u2019 as a function of societal conditions (Barfuss et al., 2023; Hintze and Adami, 2015). This means that a small directional change in societal conditions may, on occasion, trigger a transition to a defective equilibrium which requires a larger reversal of that change in order to return to the original cooperative equilibrium. We would do well to avoid such tipping points. Social media provides a compelling illustration of how tipping points can undermine cooperation: content that goes \u2018viral\u2019 tends to involve negativity bias and sometimes challenges core societal values (Mousavi et al., 2022; see Chapter 16). Nonetheless, the challenge posed by runaway processes should not be regarded as uniformly problematic. When harnessed appropriately and suitably bounded, we may even recruit them to support beneficial forms of cooperative AI. For example, it has been argued that economically useful ideas are becoming harder to find, thus leading to low economic growth (Bloom et al., 2020). By deploying AI assistants in the service of technological innovation, we may once again accelerate the discovery of ideas. New ideas, discovered in this way, can then be incorporated into the training data set for future AI assistants, thus expanding the knowledge base for further discoveries in a compounding way. In a similar vein, we can imagine AI assistant technology accumulating various capabilities for enhancing human cooperation, for instance by mimicking the evolutionary processes that have bootstrapped cooperative behavior in human society (Leibo et al., 2019). When used in these ways, the potential for feedback cycles that enable greater cooperation is a phenomenon that warrants further research and potential support.\"", "Entity": "3 - Other", "Intent": "3 - Other", "Timing": "3 - Other", "Domain": "7.

Many of the access-related risks we foresee mirror those described in the case studies and types of differential access. In this section, we link them more tightly to elements of the definition of an advanced AI assistant to better understand and mitigate potential issues \u2013 and lay the path for assistants that support widespread and inclusive opportunity and access. We begin with the existing capabilities set out in the definition (see Chapter 2) before applying foresight to those that are more novel and emergent. Current capabilities: Artificial agents with natural language interfaces. Artificial agents with natural language interfaces are widespread (Browne, 2023) and increasingly integrated into the social fabric and existing information infrastructure, including search engines (Warren, 2023), business messaging apps (Slack, 2023), research tools (ATLAS.ti, 2023) and accessibility apps for blind and low-vision people (Be My Eyes, 2023). There is already evidence of a range of sociotechnical harms that can arise from the use of artificial agents with natural language interfaces when some communities have inferior access to them (Weidinger et al., 2021). As previously described, these harms include inferior quality of access (in situation type 2) across user groups, which may map onto wider societal dynamics involving race (Harrington et al., 2022), disability (Gadiraju et al., 2023) and culture (Jenka, 2023). As developers make it easier to integrate these technologies into other tools, services and decision-making systems (e.g. Marr, 2023; Brockman et al., 2023; Pinsky, 2023), their uptake could make existing performance inequities more pronounced or introduce them to new and wider publics.\"", "Entity": "1 - Human", "Intent": "2 - Unintentional", "Timing": "2 - Post-deployment", "Domain": "6.

However, an artificial agent that can execute sequences of actions on the user\u2019s behalf \u2013 with \u2018significant autonomy to plan and execute tasks within the relevant domain\u2019 (see Chapter 2) \u2013 offers a greater range of capabilities and depth of use. This raises several distinct access-related risks, with respect to liability and consent, that may disproportionately affect historically marginalised communities. To repeat, in cases where an action can only be executed with an advanced AI assistant, not having access to the technology (e.g. due to limited internet access, not speaking the \u2018right\u2019 language or facing a paywall) means one cannot access that action (consider today\u2019s eBay and Ticketmaster bots). Communication with many utility or commercial providers currently requires (at least initial) interaction with their artificial agents (Schwerin, 2023; Verma, 2023a). It is not difficult to imagine a future in which a user needs an advanced AI assistant to interface with a more consequential resource, such as their hospital for appointments or their phone company to obtain service. Cases of inequitable performance, where the assistant systematically performs less well for certain communities (situation type 2), could impose serious costs on people in these contexts. Moreover, advanced AI assistants are expected to be designed to act in line with user expectations. When acting on the user\u2019s behalf, an assistant will need to infer aspects of what the user wants. This process may involve interpretation to decide between various sources of information (e.g. stated preferences and inference based on past feedback or user behaviour) (see Chapter 5). However, cultural differences will also likely affect the system\u2019s ability to make an accurate inference. Notably, the greater the cultural divide, say between that of the developers and the data on which the agent was trained and evaluated on, and that of the user, the harder it will be to make reliable inferences about user wants (e.g. Beede et al., 2020; Widner et al., 2023), and greater the likelihood of performance failures or value misalignment (see Chapter 11). This inference gap could make many forms of indirect opportunity inaccessible, and as past history indicates, there is the risk that harms associated with these unknowns may disproportionately fall upon those already marginalised in the design process.\"", "Entity": "3 - Other", "Intent": "3 - Other", "Timing": "3 - Other", "Domain": "6.

Emergent risks can be difficult to foresee fully (Ovadya and Whittlestone, 2019; Prunkl et al., 2021) due to the novelty of the technology (see Chapter 1) and the biases of those who engage in product design or foresight processes D\u2019Ignazio and Klein (2020). Indeed, people who occupy relatively advantaged social, educational and economic positions in society are often poorly equipped to foresee and prevent harm because they are disconnected from lived experiences of those who would be affected. Drawing upon access concerns that surround existing technologies, we anticipate three possible trends: \u2022 Trend 1: Technology as societal infrastructure. If advanced AI assistants are adopted by organisations or governments in domains affecting material well-being, \u2018opting out\u2019 may no longer be a real option for people who want to continue to participate meaningfully in society. Indeed, if this trend holds, there could be serious consequences for communities with no access to AI assistants or who only have access to less capable systems (see also Chapter 14). For example, if advanced AI assistants gate access to information and resources, these resources could become inaccessible for people with limited knowledge of how to use these systems, reflecting the skill-based dimension of digital inequality (van Dijk, 2006). Addressing these questions involves reaching beyond technical and logistical access considerations \u2013 and expanding the scope of consideration to enable full engagement and inclusion for differently situated communities. \u2022 Trend 2: Exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Technologies are not distinct from but embedded within wider sociopolitical assemblages (Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1998, 2016). If advanced AI assistants are institutionalised and adopted at scale without proper foresight and mitigation measures in place, then they are likely to scale or exacerbate inequalities that already exist within the sociocultural context in which the system is used (Bauer and Lizotte, 2021; Zajko, 2022). If the historical record is anything to go by, the performance inequities evidenced by advanced AI assistants could mirror social hierarchies around gender, race, disability and culture, among others \u2013 asymmetries that deserve deeper consideration and need to be significantly addressed (e.g. Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018). \u2022 Trend 3: Rendering more urgent responsible AI development and deployment practices, such as those supporting the development of technologies that perform fairly and are accountable to a wide range of parties. As Corbett and Denton (2023, 1629) argue: \u2018The impacts of achieving [accountability and fairness] in almost any situation immediately improves the conditions of people\u2019s lives and better society\u2019. However, many approaches to developing AI systems, including assistants, pay little attention to how context shapes what accountability or fairness means (Sartori and Theodorou, 2022), or how these concepts can be put in service of addressing inequalities related to motivational access (e.g. wanting/trust in technology) or use (e.g. different ways to use a technology) (van Dijk, 2006). Advanced AI assistants are complex technologies that will enable a plurality of data and content flows that necessitate in-depth analysis of social impacts. As many sociotechnical and responsible AI practices were developed for conventional ML technologies, it may be necessary to develop new frameworks, approaches and tactics (see Chapter 19).

Increasingly agentic AI assistants trained using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and with the ability to access and analyse users\u2019 behavioural data, for example, may learn to tailor their responses to users\u2019 preferences and feedback. In doing so, these systems could end up producing partial or ideologically biased statements in an attempt to conform to user expectations, desires or preferences for a particular worldview (Carroll et al., 2022). Over time, this could lead AI assistants to inadvertently reinforce people\u2019s tendency to interpret information in a way that supports their own prior beliefs (\u2018confirmation bias\u2019), thus making them more entrenched in their own views and more resistant to factual corrections (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). At the societal level, this could also exacerbate the problem of epistemic fragmentation \u2013 a breakdown of shared knowledge, where individuals have conflicting understandings of reality and do not share or engage with each other\u2019s beliefs \u2013 and further entrench specific ideologies. Excessive trust and overreliance on hyperpersonalised AI assistants could become especially problematic if people ended up deferring entirely to these systems to perform tasks in domains they do not have expertise in or to take consequential decisions on their behalf (see Chapter 12). For example, people may entrust an advanced AI assistant that is familiar with their political views and personal preferences to help them find trusted election information, guide them through their political choices or even vote on their behalf, even if doing so might go against their own or society\u2019s best interests. In the more extreme cases, these developments may hamper the normal functioning of democracies, by decreasing people\u2019s civic competency and reducing their willingness and ability to engage in productive political debate and to participate in public life (Sullivan and Transue, 1999).\"", "Entity": "2 - AI", "Intent": "2 - Unintentional", "Timing": "2 - Post-deployment", "Domain": "3.

One concern is that it could result in a degradation of the quality of the information available online. Researchers have already observed an uptick in the amount of audiovisual misinformation, elaborate scams and fake websites created using generative AI tools (Hanley and Durumeric, 2023). As more and more people turn to AI assistants to autonomously create and disseminate information to public audiences at scale, it may become increasingly difficult to parse and verify reliable information. This could further threaten and complicate the status of journalists, subject-matter experts and public information sources. Over time, a proliferation of spam, misleading or low-quality synthetic content in online spaces could also erode the digital knowledge commons \u2013 the shared knowledge resources accessible to everyone on the web, such as publicly accessible data repositories (Huang and Siddarth, 2023). At its extreme, such degradation could also end up skewing people\u2019s view of reality and scientific consensus, make them more doubtful of the credibility of all information they encounter and shape public discourse in unproductive ways.

Studies show that spreaders of disinformation tend to privilege quantity over quality of messaging, flooding online spaces repeatedly with misleading content to sow \u2018seeds of doubt\u2019 (Hassoun et al., 2023). Research on the \u2018continued influence effect\u2019 also shows that repeatedly being exposed to false information is more likely to influence someone\u2019s thoughts than a single exposure. Studies show, for example, that repeated exposure to false information makes people more likely to believe it by increasing perceived social consensus, and it makes people more resistant to changing their minds even after being given a correction (for a review of these effects, see Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Ecker et al., 2022). By leveraging the frequent and personalised nature of repeated interactions with an AI assistant, malicious actors could therefore gradually nudge voters towards a particular viewpoint or sets of beliefs over time (see Chapters 8 and 9). Propagandists could also use AI assistants to make their disinformation campaigns more personalised and effective. There is growing evidence that AI-generated outputs are as persuasive as human arguments and have the potential to change people\u2019s minds on hot-button issues (Bai et al., 2023; Myers, 2023). Recent research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed that LLMs could be successfully prompted to generate \u2018persuasive misinformation\u2019 in 78 out of 100 test cases, including content denying climate change (see Chapters 9 and 18). If compromised by malicious actors, in the future, highly capable and autonomous AI assistants could therefore be programmed to run astroturfing campaigns autonomously, tailor misinformation content to users in a hyperprecise way, by preying on their emotions and vulnerabilities, or to accelerate lobbying activities (Kreps and Kriner, 2023). As a result, people may be misled into believing that content produced by weaponised AI assistants came from genuine or authoritative sources.

For example, exclusionary norms occur when the training data represents only a fraction of the population (Zhuo et al., 2023). Similarly, monolingual bias in multilingualism arises when the training data is in one single language (Weidinger et al., 2021). As ChatGPT is operating across the world, cultural sensitivities to different regions are crucial to avoid biases (Dwivedi et al., 2023).

Hence, the representativeness, completeness, and diversity of the training data are essential to ensure fairness and avoid biases (Gonzalez, 2023). The use of synthetic data for training can increase the diversity of the dataset and address issues with sample-selection biases in the dataset (owing to class imbalances) (Chen et al., 2021).

ChatGPT can be used as a high-tech plagiarism tool that identifies patterns from large corpora to generate content (Gefen & Arinze, 2023). Given that generative AI such as ChatGPT can generate high-quality answers within seconds, unmotivated students may not devote time and effort to work on their assignments and essays. Hence, in the era of generative AI, the originality of the work done by students could be difficult to assess. Text written by ChatGPT is regarded as plagiarism and is not acceptable (Thorp, 2023). Another form of misuse is cheating in examinations. If students have access to digital devices during examinations, they can resort to using ChatGPT to assist them in answering the questions. To address potential misuse in education, AI-generated content detectors such as Turnitin could be used and strict proctoring measures will need to be deployed (Susnjak, 2022).

In the development stage of ChatGPT, a huge amount of personal and private data was used to train it, which threatens privacy (Siau & Wang, 2020). As ChatGPT increases in popularity and usage, it penetrates people\u2019s daily lives and provides greater convenience to them while capturing a plethora of personal information about them. The concerns and accompanying risks are that private information could be exposed to the public, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, it has been reported that the chat records of some users have become viewable to others due to system errors in ChatGPT (Porter, 2023). Not only individual users but major corporations or governmental agencies are also facing information privacy and security issues. If ChatGPT is used as an inseparable part of daily operations such that important or even confidential information is fed into it, data security will be at risk and could be breached. To address issues regarding privacy and security, users need to be very circumspect when interacting with ChatGPT to avoid disclosing sensitive personal information or confidential information about their organizations. AI companies, especially technology giants, should take appropriate actions to increase user awareness of ethical issues surrounding privacy and security, such as the leakage of trade secrets, and the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d to prevent sharing sensitive information with generative AI.

These behaviors canpotentially make detecting and addressing misaligned behaviors much harder.Deceptive Alignment: Misaligned AI systems may deliberately mislead their human supervisors instead of adhering to the intended task. Such deceptive behavior has already manifested in AI systems that employ evolutionary algorithms (Wilke et al., 2001; Hendrycks et al., 2021b). In these cases, agents evolved the capacity to differentiate between their evaluation and training environments. They adopted a strategic pessimistic response approach during the evaluation process, intentionally reducing their reproduction rate within a scheduling program (Lehman et al., 2020). Furthermore, AI systems may engage in intentional behaviors that superficially align with the reward signal, aiming to maximize rewards from human supervisors (Ouyang et al., 2022). It is noteworthy that current large language models occasionally generate inaccurate or suboptimal responses despite having the capacity to provide more accurate answers (Lin et al., 2022c; Chen et al., 2021). These instances of deceptive behavior present significant challenges. They undermine the ability of human advisors to offer reliable feedback (as humans cannot make sure whether the outputs of the AI models are truthful and faithful).
