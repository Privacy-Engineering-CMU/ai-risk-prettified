# AI Risk Database Prettified
## [https://privacy-engineering-cmu.github.io/ai-risk-prettified/](https://privacy-engineering-cmu.github.io/ai-risk-prettified/)

## What is the AI Risk Database?
The AI Risk Database captures 700+ risks extracted from 43 existing frameworks, with quotes and page numbers.

## Disclaimer:
This is not a work done by CMU students but rather by MIT. Please support and check out the actual database: https://airisk.mit.edu/#How-to-use-the-AI-Risk-Repository
Our goal was to simply prettify and make it easier to digest.
